# PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS REQUIREMENTS

## OVERVIEW

This document outlines the requirements for applying performance improvement systems to existing services to achieve measurable performance enhancements.

## REQUIREMENTS

### 1. MEMORY OPTIMIZATION FOR EXISTING SERVICES

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing services to use memory efficiently so that the system operates stably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technical analysis services are executed THEN memory caching and DataFrame optimization SHALL be automatically applied
2. WHEN price data services are executed THEN results SHALL be cached and memory usage SHALL be monitored
3. WHEN news crawling services are executed THEN memory optimization SHALL be applied
4. WHEN scheduler tasks are executed THEN automatic memory cleanup SHALL be performed

### 2. ASYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING FOR EXISTING SERVICES

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive fast responses to API requests and have heavy tasks processed in the background.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting technical analysis for multiple symbols THEN they SHALL be processed asynchronously in parallel
2. WHEN large data processing requests are made THEN they SHALL be processed in background via task queue
3. WHEN API responses are needed THEN they SHALL respond immediately and results SHALL be queryable separately

### 3. REAL-TIME DATA STREAMING APPLICATION

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive real-time price changes and analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users connect to WebSocket THEN they SHALL be able to receive real-time price data
2. WHEN prices change THEN notifications SHALL be sent immediately to subscribed users
3. WHEN technical analysis results are updated THEN they SHALL be broadcast in real-time

### 4. MIGRATING HEAVY TASKS TO TASK QUEUE

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want heavy tasks to be processed in the background without affecting system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN daily comprehensive report generation is requested THEN it SHALL be processed in background via task queue
2. WHEN large data collection tasks are needed THEN they SHALL be processed via task queue with progress tracking
3. WHEN technical analysis batch jobs are executed THEN they SHALL be processed according to priority

### 5. PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to measure and monitor actual performance improvement effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN memory usage, response time, and throughput SHALL be automatically measured
2. WHEN comparing before and after performance improvements THEN improvement effects SHALL be verifiable with specific metrics
3. WHEN system problems occur THEN automatic notifications SHALL be sent

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Memory Management

- LRU cache implementation with TTL support
- DataFrame memory optimization (downcasting, categorization)
- Automatic garbage collection and memory monitoring
- Memory usage threshold alerts (85% system memory)

### Asynchronous Processing

- ThreadPoolExecutor for CPU-intensive tasks
- AsyncIO for I/O-bound operations
- Semaphore-based concurrency control
- Exponential backoff retry mechanisms

### Real-time Streaming

- WebSocket connection management for 1000+ concurrent connections
- Subscription-based message routing
- Heartbeat and automatic reconnection
- Message compression for large data transfers

### Task Queue System

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Task status tracking and progress monitoring
- Worker pool management and load balancing

### Performance Monitoring

- Real-time metrics collection (memory, CPU, response time)
- Performance degradation detection (20% threshold)
- Automatic optimization triggers
- Performance dashboard with visualization

## PERFORMANCE TARGETS

### Response Time

- API response time: < 1 second (target: 300ms)
- Technical analysis: < 5 seconds for single symbol
- Batch processing: < 30 seconds for 10 symbols

### Throughput

- Concurrent requests: 200+ req/s
- WebSocket connections: 1000+ concurrent
- Task queue processing: 50+ tasks/minute

### Resource Usage

- Memory usage: < 70% of available system memory
- CPU usage: < 80% during peak load
- Cache hit rate: > 85% for frequently accessed data

### Reliability

- System uptime: > 99.9%
- Error rate: < 1% for all operations
- Automatic recovery: < 30 seconds for system failures

## COMPLIANCE AND CONSTRAINTS

### Technical Constraints

- No external infrastructure dependencies (Redis, Celery)
- Backward compatibility with existing APIs
- Gradual rollout capability with A/B testing
- Rollback mechanism for failed optimizations

### Performance Constraints

- Memory optimization must not exceed 5% accuracy loss
- Asynchronous processing must maintain data consistency
- Real-time streaming latency must be < 2 seconds
- Task queue must handle 1000+ concurrent tasks

### Operational Constraints
